This project describes a two-part Convolutional Neural Network
structure is where the in the first part a model is trained from
image datasets to detect face coverings on people’s faces and
the second part consists of using a lightweight object detection
classifier which will draw a bounding box around people’s
faces, classify and display the proper label of ‘MASK’ or ‘NO
MASK’. The system can then be integrated with an image or
video capturing device like a CCTV camera, to track safety
violations, promote the use of face masks, and ensure public
safety.
